      <p>To ensure your video support assessment goes as smoothly as possible,
        please follow these simple instructions. These can also be found in your
        booking confirmation email.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If you’re unable to attend your assessment, you can rearrange it up to 24 hours before the scheduled start time.</li>
        <li>If you opted for reminders by email, you will receive them 24 hours and then again 1 hour before your assessment.</li>
        <li>The confirmation email and reminders will contain details of your counsellor and the link you’ll need to start your assessment. If you don't receive these emails, please check your spam or junk mail folder. If you still haven't received them, please contact us on <a href="mailto: online.community@sueryder.org">online.community@sueryder.org</a>.</li>
        <li>You can begin the assessment by clicking the link in the email we sent you. Please note you can only start the video chat at the time of your assessment. We'd also advise trying to find a quiet place where you can talk openly.</li>
        <li>After your assessment, you will be sent an email with instructions on how to book your first of six video support sessions with either a fully qualified counsellor or a trained support worker.</li>
